# MODE noOpt configuration
#
# WARNING: Do not edit this mode unless you know what you are
#          doing.  By default, this is set to disable optimization
#          of packages known to have build or runtime failure.
#
# Usage: - Apply optimization string to each variable
#        - "unset" will cause the variable to be not set
#          instead of being just set to null.
